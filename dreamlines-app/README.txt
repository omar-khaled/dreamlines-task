- to start the application just use the terminal to navigate to /dreamlines-app
- run npm install
- run npm start
- navigate to http://localhost:3000/

then you can go through the app
- i have created 7 different users can be found in modules/DB.js
user1, user2, user3, ...... for their ids to match ids from the fake json generator

- other than that i think everything should be clear, also we can disscuss in the code review or you can contact me anytime if you want.
